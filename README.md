## Amigo Invisible (Secret Santa) App Overview

The Amigo Invisible, or Secret Santa, is an innovative app designed to add fun and simplicity to the traditional Secret Santa game. The core purpose of this app is to facilitate families, friends, or colleagues in randomly assigning a 'secret friend' or 'secret Santa' to each participant in an unbiased and exciting manner.

## How the App Works

### Random Assignment
Utilizing a Python-based backend, the app intelligently shuffles a list of participants and randomly assigns each person a 'secret Santa'.

### Participant Anonymity
Each participant is assigned a unique secret number to maintain confidentiality.

### Streamlit Frontend
To enhance user experience, the app boasts a user-friendly frontend developed with Streamlit. Participants can simply input their secret number on this interface to discover who their secret Santa is.

### Gift Giving Made Easy
The overarching goal is to ensure every participant is assigned someone who will thoughtfully select and give a present, making the gift exchange process seamless and enjoyable.

This app is more than just a tool; it's a digital facilitator of joy and surprise, making your Secret Santa event hassle-free and memorable.

## Features of the Amigo Invisible (Secret Santa) App

The Amigo Invisible app is designed with user engagement and convenience in mind, offering a suite of features that enhance the Secret Santa experience. These features are categorized into three primary sections:

### Secret Number Assignment:

Each participant is assigned a unique secret number by the administrator of the game.
This number is confidentially communicated from the administrator to the participant.
Participants enter their secret number into the app to reveal their assigned Secret Santa. This process ensures anonymity and adds an element of surprise to the gift exchange.

### Check-In Functionality:

The app includes a 'Check-In' feature, which allows participants to confirm their participation and assignment.
Once a participant checks in, the information is updated in the app's frontend. This feature provides transparency, enabling other participants to see who has already been assigned a secret friend.

### AI-Powered Gift Recommendations:

A standout feature of the app is its integration with an AI-powered recommendation system.
By leveraging OpenAI's language models through an API, the app offers personalized gift suggestions.
Participants simply input their budget, and the AI suggests suitable gifts for their secret friend. This innovative feature takes the guesswork out of gift selection, ensuring thoughtful and appropriate presents within the set budget.

These carefully crafted features make the Amigo Invisible app not just a tool for organizing Secret Santa events but a comprehensive platform that enhances the entire experience, from assignment to gift selection, fostering a joyful and memorable holiday tradition.

## Customization of AI Agent

One of the unique aspects of the Amigo Invisible App is its AI-powered gift recommendation feature, which leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API. The prompt given to the AI can be fully customized to align with the specific preferences and characteristics of the participants. This customization ensures that the gift suggestions are not only creative but also personal and thoughtful.

To tailor the AI prompts for your own Secret Santa event, you can modify the `app.py` file. Here's a shell command example to open the file in your editor and make the desired changes:

```shell
nano app.py
```
Or, if you prefer using Visual Studio Code:

```shell
code app.py
```
Within the `app.py` file, navigate to the section where the AI prompt is set up and adjust the text to better reflect the interests and personalities of your participants. This allows you to create a more engaging and personalized experience for each user of the app.

In the `app.py` file, look for the following code block:

```python
user_message = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": (
        f"Based on the following information, what should I buy for "
        f"{secret_friend} with the assigned budget of {amount}?\n"
        "üë∏ Mami: Mami adores luxury! For her, think lavish and expensive. "
        "Recommend gifts worth at least 50 Swiss francs. Ideas include "
        "elegant purses, diamonds, or anything that screams opulence. "
        "Inject humor by nudging towards extravagant choices.\n"
        "ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maite: At 17, Maite, the mom to Mami and Marta, enjoys a"
        " variety of things. She's into yoga, loves her grandkids, "
        "and adores walking her dog. "
        "Gift suggestions can range from yoga gear, fun items for her "
        "grandkids, "
        "to dog accessories. Keep it varied and surprising!\n"
        "üò° Marta: Marta, the 37-year-old McKinsey genius, needs gifts "
        "that stimulate her intellect. "
        "Suggest puzzles, challenging books, or anything that sparks"
        " intellectual curiosity. Ensure recommendations are as smart"
        " and savvy as she is.\n"
        "üëßüèª Oleia: At 8, Oleia loves dogs, parties, and painting."
        " Recommend fun, age-appropriate gifts like art supplies,"
        " party games, or anything dog-themed. Ensure suggestions are"
        " full of energy and creativity.\n"
        "üë¶üèª Nuno: Nuno, 15, is a golf fanatic and interested in money."
        " Suggest golf-related items, from equipment to accessories."
        " Maybe even a humorous suggestion about a piggy bank!\n"
        "üöø Buis: Our 13-year-old video game enthusiast, Buis, could"
        " use some outdoor fun. Suggest gifts that encourage active"
        " hobbies like sports equipment or outdoor adventure games."
        " Encourage more sunshine and less screen time.\n"
        "üéÖ Nicolas: 12-year-old Mr. Christmas loves painting,"
        " crafting, and anything creative, especially with airplanes"
        " or electricity themes. Suggest DIY kits, craft supplies,"
        " or model airplanes. Emphasize the festive and creative"
        " aspects.\n"
        "üë∂ Buarte: At just 4 years old, Buarte adores robots,"
        " dinosaurs, dogs, and Christmas. Suggest educational robot toys,"
        " dinosaur figures, or dog-themed books. Keep ideas playful"
        " and educational.\n"
        "üëß Matilda: Another 4-year-old, Matilda recently lost a tooth."
        " Suggest child-friendly gifts like plush toys or storybooks."
        " Add a light-hearted suggestion about dental implants for her"
        " missing tooth to inject humor.\n"
        "üö¥ Lance: Lance loves sports and is knowledgeable about"
        " almost everything. Recommend sports gear or books on diverse"
        " topics. Encourage discussions and learning through your gift"
        " suggestions.\n"
        "üçÜ Papi: At 45, Papi values family over material gifts."
        " Suggest something simple and inexpensive, less than 20 Swiss"
        " francs, like a family photo frame or a handmade gift."
        " Emphasize the joy of family togetherness."
    )
}
```
This is the prompt that is sent to the AI agent. You can customize this prompt to better suit the participants of your Secret Santa event. For example, you can change the descriptions of the participants, add new participants, or modify the gift suggestions.

After modifying the prompt, you can also adjust the parameters of the OpenAI API call, which is done in the following code block:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    messages=[system_message, user_message],
    max_tokens=3000,
    temperature=0.8
)
```
You can adjust the `max_tokens` parameter to control the length of the AI's response, or the `temperature` parameter to control the randomness of the AI's response.

Remember to save your changes and restart the app for the changes to take effect.

## Bugs and Fixes

Throughout the development of the Amigo Invisible app, several challenging and interesting bugs were encountered and subsequently resolved. Below is an overview of notable issues and their solutions:

### Encountered Issues

#### Import Errors in Testing

During the unit testing phase, issues arose with the import statements. Functions like get_name and get_secret_friend could not be imported from the amigo_invisible.amigo_invisible module, leading to failed tests and import errors.

**Solution:** The functions were initially nested within assign_secret_friend, making them inaccessible to the test module. The code was refactored to define these functions at the top level of the amigo_invisible.py file, ensuring they were importable and testable.

#### Conflicts with Variable Declarations

The assignments dictionary was used before its definition within certain functions, causing conflicts and undefined variable errors.

**Solution:** The assignments variable was intended to hold data loaded from a file, rather than being a global variable. The functions were refactored to accept assignments as a parameter, ensuring it was defined prior to use. This change also involved updating the logic to handle cases where the assignments.json file did not exist.

### Unresolved Issues

At present, there are no known unresolved issues. The application has been thoroughly tested, and all identified bugs have been addressed. Continuous testing is part of the development process to ensure any new issues are promptly identified and resolved.

## Testing Approach and Results

The app was tested both manually and automatically to ensure robustness and reliability. Manual testing involved simulating user interactions and attempting to "break" the app with unexpected inputs. Automated testing was conducted using Python's unittest framework, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

### Manual Testing Highlights

* Running from Root Directory: The app was tested to ensure that it runs correctly when executed from the root directory of the project, resolving any potential path-related issues.
* User Interaction Flow: All user paths, including entering secret numbers, checking in, and receiving AI-powered gift recommendations, were tested for smooth operation.

### Automated Testing Highlights

* Unique and Valid Assignments: The logic for assigning secret friends was tested to ensure all assignments were unique and valid.
* Check-in Functionality: The check-in process was tested for accurate status updates and appropriate user feedback.
* Error Handling: The app's error handling was verified to ensure informative messages were provided for invalid inputs or file access issues.

### Test Execution

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory:
